# ATOM ONTOLOGY — canonical composition of atomized card subcomponents

Status: **BINDING** (4 adversarial gate rounds 2026-10-19, round-4 GO; owner stop
condition met — see §9). Owner directive
2026-10-19: as FEW subcomponents as possible covering everything needed;
functionally-identical wordings MUST land in the SAME atoms in the SAME canonical
order; the combination tree must be standard and predictable. Evidence
(COMMIT-RESIDENT): `tools/audit/ontology_shape_census.py` →
`reports/ontology_census_2026-10-19.json` (546 cards / 1168 abilities / 469 shape
clusters / branching map) + `tools/audit/atom_field_table.py` (V1′ single source:
25-field CLASSIFY) + `tools/audit/atom_sortdelta.py` →
`reports/atom_sortdelta_2026-10-19.json` (R1a byte-delta evidence, N-v4) +
`KNOWLEDGE/2026-10-19/126-*` (digest, gate log, NUMBERS.md volumes). IR: `MTG_bot/core/ability_tree.py` (80 dataclass nodes).
Standing laws operated on, never restated: AGENTS §9 orthogonality, §10 visibility,
§11 zero-loss.

## 0. Consumers
1. **Translation agents (template authors)**: emit canonical shapes; §5 map is the
   menu of approved shapes; T1/O-laws below are diff-gate checklist items.
2. **Adversarial/diff gates**: checker §6 reports violations mechanically.
3. **Model-facing encoding (future)**: IR serialization IS the card tokenizer (§8);
   `canonical_json` (:4670) is the identity path.
4. **Engine**: frozen-IR value equality (goldens, dedup) requires canonicalization AT
   CONSTRUCTION — precedent `AtomArgs.pairs` role-sort (:2541).

## 1. The composition tree

```
card      := CardRecord(abilities+)                       # printed order kept (§3)
ability   := Triggered(event, condition?, effect)
           | Activated(cost, effect, condition?, timing)
           | Static(effect, condition?) | Spell(kind, effect, additional_costs*)
           | Replacement(event, condition?, action) | Keyword | EtBState
           | CostModifier | Emblem | Kicker | BackFace
effect    := Atom(verb, role→value pairs)                 # ONE operation = ONE Atom (T1)
           | Seq(steps 2+)                               # TIME: printed order (O2)
           | Choose(count, options 2+)                   # MENU: printed order
           | OptionalEffect(inner) | Conditional(pred, then, else?)
           | Repeat(count, inner) | EachPlayer(ref, effect) | DelayedTrigger(...)
value     := Quantity | Selector | Filter | Zone | Duration | PtDelta | TokenSpec | LiteralName
selector  := {mode, count, filter, zone∪zones → ONE set (R0), referent}
filter    := FAnd(children) | FOr(children) | FNot(inner) | FAtom(pred, slots)
event     := ZoneChange | CastSpell | … (18 classes, census §5)
quantity  := QConst | QX | QUnbounded | QCount(sel) | QPartyCount(sel)
           | QDistinctColorCount(sel) | QProp | QBin | QThisTurn | QAtLeast | QAtMost
```

Ability = fusion unit: **{when-event} × {gates} × {cost} × {operations}**; operation =
§9 axes {operation, menu, count, effect-of-each-choice} realized ONLY as the
Atom+Selector+Quantity triple — any second encoding is a §4 ledger item.

## 2. Wording-order fusion (owner example → law)

"Deal 2 damage to target creature" ≡ "Choose target creature, deal 2 damage to it":
designation occurs at ANNOUNCEMENT (CR 601.2c spells / 602.2b activated / 603.3a
triggered; 608.2a is a legality re-check only) — never a sequential step. Both
wordings → the SAME single Atom with alphabetical role pairs (:2541).
**T1 (template law)**: "target / each X that… / a creature" phrases become the ROLE
(Selector value) of the Atom they feed — never a standalone node, never a Seq step.
Grammar already type-rejects Selector-as-step (:2609); T1's live anti-pattern is the
SPLIT `Seq[Atom(TAP,{t}), Atom(DAMAGE,{t′})]` for ONE operation → checker V3′.

## 3. Ordering law — COMPLETE field-coverage table (V1′ baseline)

Detection rule (binding, single source `tools/audit/atom_field_table.py` — it
regenerates this table AND the checker's CLASSIFY dict, exiting nonzero on any
UNCLASSIFIED runtime field or STALE dict entry; `/126` carries the table rows):
a CONTAINER field = annotation contains `tuple[` | `frozenset[` | `list[`.
Runtime scan: **25 container fields** = 24 `tuple[` + 1 `frozenset[`
(`CardRecord.color_identity`), 80 classes, zero unclassified.

| class.field | annotation | CLASSIFY | canonical form |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seq.steps | tuple[Effect,…] | **TIME** | printed order preserved, never tool-sorted; Seq[1] forbidden (corpus 0) |
| Choose.options | tuple[Effect,…] | **MENU** | printed order (identity); same-menu/diff-order cross-card pairs ⇒ WARN + MANUAL review (ledger D7: census §B detects flat/nesting only, no menu-order matcher — none observed in 546 cards; build the matcher when a pair actually occurs) |
| CardRecord.abilities / BackFace.abilities / TokenSpec.abilities | tuple[Ability,…] | **IDENTITY** | printed order |
| CardRecord.types/subtypes/supertypes/colors, color_identity(frozenset) | tuple/frozenset | **IDENTITY** | oracle-printed data, membership tests; no sort (fidelity; to_dict sorts color_identity) |
| AtomArgs.pairs | tuple[(role,value),…] | **SET-ENFORCED** | role-sorted at construction — ALREADY ENFORCED :2541 (measured: sorted on every card) |
| FAnd.children / FOr.children | tuple[Filter,…] | **SET-R1a** | construction sort by canonical_json(child) + same-class flatten + single-child unwrap (eval purity gate-verified binding.py:219–236) |
| CardRecord.keywords | tuple[KeywordAbility,…] | **SET-R1a** | grant-membership order-free (keyword_of scans; same-timestamp layers re-order by layer rules) — sort (v3→v4 gate A2: field was MISSING from v3) |
| TokenSpec.types/subtypes/keywords | tuple | **SET-R1a** | COMPILER-EMITTED data, not oracle print (v4 gate A4: canonicalize, not declare divergence) — sort |
| FAtom.colors | tuple[str,…] | **SET-R1a** | filter membership only — sort |
| EtBState.initial_counters | tuple[(CounterKind,Quantity),…] | **SET-R1a** | counter dict keyed by kind; sort |
| Cost.parts | tuple[CostPart,…] | **SET-R1b** | payment order-free (PAYMENT_ORDER legality.py:138) but planning order-keyed (:721 min-clamp, :755 hybrid append, failure-string, witness digest) ⇒ sort ONLY after planning-determinization |
| SpellAbility.additional_costs | tuple[Cost,…] | **SET-R1b** (v4, gate A3) | folds into the SAME order-keyed planner (legality.py:1272 kicker fold → spell_cost → build_payment_plan); corpus Δ0 today only because no multi-entry case exists = untestable landmine if sorted in R1a |
| CostManaHybrid.colors | tuple[str,str] | **SET-R1b** (v4, gate A3) | hybrid_demands raw-tuple-keyed (legality.py:755/887) |
| Selector.zone + Selector.zones | Zone + tuple[Zone,…] | **SET-R0** | **R0 schema fold**: ONE `zones: tuple[Zone,…]` (heterogeneous Zone objects whole), construction sort by canonical_json (Zone is not orderable — bare sorted() TypeError trap), C2 referent convention keeps neutral `Zone(ANY,ANY)`; `Selector.zone` (scalar) deleted; ALL consumers set-iterate; PRIMARY-ZONE-KEYED LANES become ∃-predicates: selectors.py:428-430 (r19b TOP window — lane body :445 must extract the MATCHED LIBRARY+TOP zone's controller, not ∃-test-then-reuse), :484 (16a PLAYER re-point), :705/:754, verbs.py:247-249 (firemaw) |
| KeywordAbility.params | tuple[Quantity\|Filter\|Cost,…] | **OPERATOR** | positional (mode-specific arg slots) |
| CostModifier.extra_deltas | tuple[CostDelta,…] | **OPERATOR-AUDIT** | sum-order presumed free; R1b audit before any SET reclass |
| QBin.left/right, Conditional.then/else, ordinals (CardDrawn, CastSpell), DelayedTrigger slots | scalars/named fields | **OPERATOR** | position IS semantics (field names, not order) |

**O2 (time law)**: Seq order kept because later steps may DEPEND on earlier ones
("for each of those", mid-resolution QProp, later-step legality) and printed order is
card identity (§11). NOT justified by trigger queues: mid-resolution triggers wait
for the next priority pass, relative order = controller choice (CR 603.3b) — hence
independent-step swaps are functional dups with DIFFERENT IR → divergence ledger
(0 swap pairs observed; prior logged, not exploited).
**O3 (set law)**: SET fields sort AT CONSTRUCTION (frozen `__post_init__` +
object.__setattr__, :2541 precedent). No runtime rewriting; `N` below is exactly the
constructor set.

## 4. Fusion ledger (fewest-atoms program; Type-1 gated; one merge per round)

| id | concept | state | decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | controller direction | **RESOLVED 2026-10-10** (NUMBERS /65: event_direction_field 42/41→0 tripwire, controllers_is 173/121 sole encoding). Today's E1 "×7" was FIELD-LIST overcount. | residual re-audit (cheap, piggybacks R2): verify Zone.controller / QProp.referent / EachPlayer.ref are DISTINCT axes, not surviving direction duplicates |
| F2 | choose-family | Choose fixed-options 28×; SelectorMode.CHOOSE 174×; ONE_OF 25×; REST 10× | ONE axis {op,menu,count}; **emission freeze NOW** (V4′): no NEW compiled CHOOSE pending R3 blindness audit (AGENTS §10) |
| F3 | cost↔effect twins | Cost{Sacrifice,Discard,Tap,PutCounter} vs Verb atoms | R4+, only if §9 similar-effects survives analysis |
| F4 | damage events | CombatDamageEvent vs DamageDealtEvent(combat=T/F), 13 nodes/13 cards | **LANDED R2 /140+142 2026-10-20**: CDE extinct (3 nodes folded, class deleted, journal :2129 preserved); D13 split-over-fire ACCEPTED pin, ZND-8 dedup ticket |
| F5 | optional | OptionalEffect 28× vs Kicker vs QAtMost | OptionalEffect = the may-axis; Kicker = cost-side sugar; review at R3 |
| F6 | count/X family | all in use | NOT duplicates; ZND-1g one-X law stands |
| F7 | life polarity | LifeLost verb-only | symmetric event on first card need |
| F8 | phantom menu | Choose(count==len) | V2′: must be encoded ALL |

Enum-only STRICT variance clusters (SpellKind×5, Keyword×19, PtDelta-direction) =
GOOD generalization (§9) — never fusion targets.

## 5. Branching map (discovered branchings — commit-resident)

Baseline: `reports/ontology_census_2026-10-19.json` §C (Selector 40 branchings,
Choose 4, Conditional 6, OptionalEffect 3, EachPlayer 2, DelayedTrigger 1),
regenerable (`tools/audit/ontology_shape_census.py`, command in NUMBERS.md). Top:
`{choose}{unbounded}{bf ∧ FAnd[2]} ` all-of ×92; CHOOSE ×80; TARGET ×42+37;
`{may}{Atom}` ×28; fixed Choose[2] ×24; verb×role: MODIFY_PT×79, MOVE_ZONE×66,
GRANT_ABILITY×61 — "creature → {destroy|exile|bounce|tap|PT}" = verbs consuming the
SAME Selector shape, one branching per verb, no per-wording re-nesting (2 FAnd-wrapper
anomalies corpus-wide, erased by R1a flatten).
**Registration law**: new branching = map row (dated, card-cited) + NUMBERS.md count
IN THE SAME COMMIT; 1-card rows flagged low-volume (§9).

## 6. Identity + conformance

**Identity law**: byte-equal canonical IR under N := {role-sort :2541; FAnd/FOr
sort + same-class flatten + single-child unwrap; additional_costs + initial_counters
sort; FAtom/CostManaHybrid.colors sort} is a SUFFICIENT same-function proxy; NOT
necessary — semantic dups outside N live in `docs/ATOM_DIVERGENCES.md` (D1–D7: De
Morgan/FNot placement; QAtLeast(1)≡ALL-slot alias; independent Seq swaps RULED
non-fusion; un-distributed FOr[FAnd,FAnd]; zone-twin bytes pre-R0 CLOSED BY R0;
phantom wrappers CLOSED BY R1a; MENU-order RULED review-by-hand).
MEASURED (N-v4 rule set; gate evidence COMMIT-RESIDENT at
`reports/atom_sortdelta_2026-10-19.json`, regenerable via
`tools/audit/atom_sortdelta.py`): N-v4 changes **M21 122/305 + ZNR 80/281** record
bytes — per rule: fand_order 117+72, or_order 9+6, fand_flatten_single 0+2 (Dauntless
Survivor, Negate), kwds_sort 2+0 (Basri's Lieutenant, Sporeweb Weaver),
fatom_colors_sort 1+0 (Quirion Dryad), tokenspec/counters_sort 0. **122 M21 golden
files** flagged (exact list in JSON; every changed card has a golden, 0 missing).
Idempotence PASS both pools; content-preservation PASS (multiset-of-normalized-leaves
+ Atom-node invariants); zero `replace()` resistance; AtomArgs.pairs already sorted on
every card. **PC-6 instrument law (v4, gate P1-5)**: the gate metric is
`tools/measure_grammar.py` (gate metric; PRE re-anchored 2026-10-19 by the gate's own
re-run: M21 orphans **4** / max share **.1265 MOVE_ZONE**; ZNR orphans 26 / .1547
MODIFY_PT — the old M21 1/.1168 ADD_MANA row at NUMBERS:3043 is SUPERSEDED), R1a must
re-run MEASURE_GRAMMAR
pre/post; the census-side `measure_pool` census (4/26) is a PROXY, reported only as
supporting evidence (proxy invariance double-checked by independent verb-fold).

**Checker** `tools/audit/ontology_conformance.py` (read-only pool pass; NEVER via
`walk()` — `_walk_value` :4704 skips lists):
- V1′ FIELD-COVERAGE: the checker IMPORTS the CLASSIFY dict from
  `tools/audit/atom_field_table.py` (single source — same module regenerates the §3
  table); runtime scan per the detection rule (annotation contains `tuple[` |
  `frozenset[` | `list[`); UNCLASSIFIED container field ⇒ ERROR, STALE CLASSIFY entry
  (field gone) ⇒ ERROR — doc/code duplication is structurally impossible (the doc
  table is generated from the module). Detection includes frozenset BY RULE (the
  24-vs-25 counting dispute is closed by the rule, not the count).
- V2′ PHANTOM: Seq[1], single-child FAnd/FOr, Choose(count==len(options)) ⇒ ERROR.
- V3′ SPLIT heuristic (WARN only): two Seq steps carrying BYTE-IDENTICAL fresh
  TARGET-mode Selectors where a later step re-designates — canonical form uses the
  referent-bound selector (C2 convention :1180). EXCLUDES ALL/ONE_OF/REST/referent
  modes (legal identical repeats: independent designations, all-of loops); ships with
  SYNTHETIC TP fixtures (corpus has 0 TPs — unverifiable on this sample, gate A3).
- V4′ EMISSION FREEZE: counts NEW SelectorMode.CHOOSE nodes in the COMPILED-IR diff
  (not template source text — compiler.py:1242/1280/1292 generic lanes emit CHOOSE
  without the token appearing in a template diff, gate A4); whitelist file ships
  with the checker.
- V5′ MAP DRIFT: compiled shape without a §5 map row ⇒ WARN → registration law.

Gate law: template rounds carry checker Δ0 (V1′/V2′/V4′) + Δreview (V3′/V5′).

## 7. Worked examples

```
"Deal 2 damage to target creature" ≡ "Choose target creature, deal 2 damage to it"
  → Atom(DEAL_DAMAGE, {amount:QConst(2), target:Selector(TARGET,creature…)})  # ≡ bytes
"Search your library and graveyard for a land" ≡ "…your graveyard and library…"
  → PRE-R0: zone-key wording forks (NOT yet canonical — R0 fixes);
    POST-R0: Selector(zones=sorted{GRAVEYARD,LIBRARY} as Zone objects) byte-equal.
"Deal 3 damage to target creature, then draw a card" vs swapped wording
  → Seq[A,B] vs Seq[B,A]: DIFFERENT IR — independence undecidable at compile time;
    logged as KNOWN divergence class (O2), never tool-normalized.
"Destroy target creature. Draw a card." (one ability) vs two triggered abilities
  → different abilities (event differs) — ontology fuses WORDINGS, not mechanics.
```

## 8. Rollout (Type-1 gated; every prediction pre-registered MEASURED; deviation = finding)

- **R0 (gated, sequenced AFTER live sibling executor wave)**: zone∪zones → single
  `zones` schema fold. MIGRATION SURFACE (gate A1, enumerated): ~64 non-test
  `zone=` constructor sites; positional `Selector(count, mode, filter, zone)` at
  compiler.py:1050 (fold silently MIS-SLOTS args — must be edited in the same pass);
  engine-synthesized `Selector(zone=…)` at binding.py:759; ~111 test assertions on
  `.zone.kind/.controller/.position`; lane #1 body (selectors.py:445) must extract
  the MATCHED LIBRARY+TOP zone's controller (heterogeneous zones: an ∃-test that
  passes on a zone you then don't use is a silent rules change). Candidate
  ENUMERATION order changes for multi-zone selectors (query.py:1127 → offered slot
  order): R0 pre-registers OFFER-ORDER diffs in pack expectations, not only goldens.
  ∃-predicate rewrites: selectors.py:428-430/:484/:705/:754, verbs.py:247-249, each
  with an EXECUTOR-OBSERVED falsifier (r19b window, Taunter re-point, firemaw guard)
  per compiled≠executing law; golden re-baseline count MEASURED at R0 spec time
  (sortdelta rerun with the zone-fold rule).
- **R1a**: constructor sorts per §3 SET-R1a rows + checker V1′/V2′/V5′ + V4′ freeze.
  PRE-REGISTERED (measured N-v4, committed JSON): M21 **122** records + **122**
  golden files re-baseline (E1-merge/65 builder-recompute procedure, per-card
  audited, shared-regex law /115); ZNR **80**; PC-1/PC-2/PC-8 Δ0 (permutation-only
  N: idempotence + leaf-multiset invariants measured); PC-6 via `measure_grammar`
  instrument pre/post (gate metric; PRE: M21 1/.1168 ADD_MANA, ZNR 26/.1547
  MODIFY_PT); fuzz 40/40 + packs Δ0 expected (filter eval commutative).
- **R1b**: planning determinization (failure-string, witness digest, hybrid append) →
  THEN Cost.parts sort + KeyModifier.extra_deltas audit; pre-register offer/PC-2
  deltas at spec time.
- **R2**: F4 damage fold + F1 residual re-audit.
- **R3**: F2 silent-CHOOSE blindness audit (174 cards, §10) → freeze lift or redesign;
  F5 optional review.
- **R4+**: F3 twins iff §9 similar-effects survives.
Census re-run = every round's exit gate (map drift Δ0); numbers → NUMBERS.md.

## 9. Gate log
- R1 (adversarial): FIX-THEN-GO — 8 findings; resolutions in v2 (see /126).
- R2 (adversarial): FIX-THEN-GO — N5 fold REJECTED (primary-zone lanes FATAL, all
  verified in code); evidence paper-claim executed; V3′ mode-exclusions + fixtures;
  V4′ compiled-IR scope; F1 corrected to RESOLVED-2026-10-10 (E1/65) — "direction×7"
  was a field-list overcount.
- R3 (adversarial): FIX-THEN-GO, residue = ONE material class (§3 table defect) +
  bookkeeping. Verified R2-fixes 2/4/5/7/8 executed; F7 RECURRED for the R1a
  evidence itself (JSON/generator in /tmp) → v4 commits `tools/audit/atom_field_table.py`
  + `tools/audit/atom_sortdelta.py` + `reports/atom_sortdelta_2026-10-19.json`;
  A2 FATAL: v3 table MISSED CardRecord.keywords + detection rule unspecified
  (24-vs-25 counting dispute) → v4: rule = annotation contains tuple[|frozenset[|
  list[; 25 fields; single-source module emits table + checker dict with drift-fail.
  A3 MAJOR: additional_costs + CostManaHybrid.colors are the SAME order-keyed
  planner (legality.py:1272 fold verified) → reclassified SET-R1b. A1: R0 migration
  surface enumerated (positional Selector@compiler.py:1050, 111 test asserts,
  lane-body :445 extraction, offer-order diffs). A4: TokenSpec containers → SET-R1a
  (compiler-emitted, canonicalize not diverge). PC-6 instrument law (measure_grammar
  = gate metric; measure_pool = proxy). N-v4 measured: M21 122 / ZNR 80, 122 goldens.
- R4 (adversarial): **GO** — all r3 fixes verified ON DISK (module run exit 0,
  doc↔module token agreement 25/25, JSON numbers match); keyword-sort safety proven
  by measured 0 same-name keyword groups in 586 cards + membership/any-veto consumer
  shapes (layers.py:974 sorted(set(names)), legality.py:1779/476); R0/R1a byte-delta
  separability holds (no R1a sort key embeds Selector.zone). Owner stop condition
  MET (no material class; residue bookkeeping). Advisories executed pre-binding:
  /126 carries the generated table (27 rows), DIVERGENCES ledger file created
  (D1–D7), PC-6 PRE re-anchored (M21 4/.1265 MOVE_ZONE), MENU WARN declared
  manual-review (D7, no phantom matcher cited).
- BINDING STATE: rounds 1–4 complete; further ontology changes require a NEW gated
  round (any R-item that reclassifies a field or opens a normalization is Type-1).
